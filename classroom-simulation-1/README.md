# Classroom Simulation Project

## Overview
This project is a classroom simulation featuring interactive avatars that respond to mouse movements and collisions. The simulation includes humorous tooltips that enhance user engagement through colorful interactions.

## Files Description

- **index.html**: The main entry point for the web application. It sets up the classroom background image and contains the structure for displaying the avatars.

- **css/styles.css**: Contains styles for the classroom simulation, including layout, avatar styles, tooltip styles, and animations.

- **js/script.js**: Implements the physics animations for the avatars, handling mouse interactions, avatar movement, collision detection, and humorous tooltip display.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: 
   ```
   cd classroom-simulation
   ```

3. **Add Required Assets**: 
   Ensure that the background image (`bg.png`) and avatar images are placed in the same directory as `index.html`.

4. **Open `index.html`**: 
   Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the simulation.

## Additional Notes
- The JavaScript file (`script.js`) is responsible for all physics calculations and interactions, including mouse movement and collision responses.
- Tooltips are designed to randomly select from a set of humorous phrases and apply various color combinations for accessibility.

Enjoy the classroom simulation!
